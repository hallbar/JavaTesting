1.  We do not need to consider a partition where CardCollection.cards is null
because it is initialized to a protected List<Card> when a new CardCollection
is created.

Yes, everypossible state of CardCollection.cards, empty, one deck, and multiple
decks, is considered in at least one partition.

Every possible value of handPos is in at least one partition.

The partitioning could use scenarios where it is at the end of the first deck,
at the beginning of the second deck, and a card in the middle of each deck.
Right now, each of these positions falls under b6 which would need to be split
into four new partitions to meet the criteria stated.

2.  The current implementation fails for b5 because that card would not be
discarded.  Instead, the card at the end of the first deck would be the one
discarded.

3.  If the test passes for i=1 and fails for i=2, then partition b6 would cover
both scenarios even though one passes and one fails.  Since this partition has
both 1 and 2 in it, a test using only 1 which fits the criteria would not find
the bug so it would need to be at least two partitions, one containing 1 and one
containing 2.
