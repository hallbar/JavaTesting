last
An error is thrown for all inputs except for null because the for loop decrements i which tests for arr[-1] on the second run through the loop which is an error that the array index (-1) is out of bounds.
Since the if statement to check for null is before the for loop, null is the only input that does not try to use the for loop.

lastZero
An error called the NullPointerException is thrown if the input is null.
If the only zero is in index 0, then -1 is returned when 0 should be returned.

positive
The NullPointerException is thrown if the input is null.

oddOrPos
The NullPointerException is thrown if the input is null.
The incorrect value of 0 is returned for an array of {-1, -2, -3, -4, -5} but it should be 3 because -1, -3, and -5 are odd numbers.  The method does not properly identify odd negative numbers.
