Is it reproducible: Yes

Description
===========
When the initial hand is dealt to a player, the player only receives one card
instead of two.

The code causing the bug is:

	for(PlayerAction p: players ){
		dealer.dealCard(dealer);
		dealer.dealCard(p);
	}

This code only deals once for each player in the players array.

Changing the code so that there is an outer loop that runs twice will deal each
player exactly two cards at the start of the round.

-m "Edits loop for dealCard for players"
	for(int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
		for(PlayerAction p: players) {
			dealer.dealCard(p);
		}
	}

Steps to Produce/Reproduce
--------------------------
For a game with one player, the code:

	SimpleBlackjack j1 = new SimpleBlackjack(dt, new PlayerAction[]{p1});
    j1.playRound();

   	verify(dt, times(2)).dealCard(p1);

Reports that the player is only dealt one card instead of two.

For a game with two players, the code:

	SimpleBlackjack j2 = new SimpleBlackjack(dt, new PlayerAction[]{p1, p2});
   	j2.playRound();

   verify(dt, times(2)).dealCard(p1);
   verify(dt, times(2)).dealCard(p2);

Reports that the players were dealt only one card instead of two.


Expected Results
----------------
For an initial deal in a game of Blackjack, each player is dealt two cards.
In a game with a single player, that player should have two cards.  In a
game with multiple players, each player should have two cards.


Actual Results
--------------
For a game with one player, the player only has one card after the initial deal.
For a game with multiple players, each player only has one card after the
initial deal.
