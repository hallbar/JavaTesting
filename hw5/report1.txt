Is it reproducible: Yes

Description
===========
If a round is played with three players, the dealer is dealt three cards for
the initial hand.  If there is only one player, the dealer is dealt only one
card.

The code causing the bug is:

	for(PlayerAction p: players ){
		dealer.dealCard(dealer);
		dealer.dealCard(p);
	}

Changing the code so that it loops twice for the dealer will fix it so that
the dealer is given exactly two cards at the start of the round.

-m "Edits loop for dealCard"
	for(int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
		dealer.dealCard(dealer);
	}


Steps to Produce/Reproduce
--------------------------
For the following code:

	SimpleBlackjack j1 = new SimpleBlackjack(dt, new PlayerAction[]{p1});
	j1.playRound();

	verify(dt, times(2)).dealCard(dt);

The number of times that a dealer should deal the card to itself is 2
but only one card is dealt to the dealer.

For the following code:

	SimpleBlackjack j3 = new SimpleBlackjack(dt, new PlayerAction[]{p1, p2, p3});
   	j3.playRound();

   	verify(dt, times(2)).dealCard(dt)

The number of times that a dealer should deal the card to itself is 2
but three cards are dealt to the dealer.

The dealer deals one card to itself for every player that is in the game.


Expected Results
----------------
Under the version of Blackjack where the dealer has a "hole card", then there
should be only two cards dealt to the dealer for any number of players.


Actual Results
--------------
For a game with one player, the dealer is dealt one card which is one too few.
For a game with three players, the dealer is dealt three cards which is one too
many.
