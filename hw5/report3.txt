Description
===========
When the dealer dealt a card to itself, the size of dealerHand remained zero.
The "hand" that was returned from the Dealer class was the deck in its current
state.

The function to deal the card to the dealer, which is listed below, worked fine

	public void dealCard(CommonAction toPlayer) {
		Card c = this.dealCardFromDeck(true);
		toPlayer.acceptCard(c);
	}

The problem was contained within acceptCard in the dealer class as shown below:
	public void acceptCard(Card c) {
		deck.add(c);
	}

The card was being returned to the deck instead of being put in the dealer's
hand, so the dealer deck always remained empty.

To fix this, a simple change was made to acceptCard(Card c)

-m "Changes deck.add to dealerHand.add"
	public void acceptCard(Card c) {
		dealerHand.add(c);
	}

With this change, the card is being accepted by the dealer and being placed
into the dealer's hand instead of back into the deck.

The getHand() function of the Dealer class was also involved in this bug because
it returned the deck instead of returning the dealer's hand, so it was changed
from:

	public List<Card> getHand() {
		return this.deck;
	}

to:
	public List<Card> getHand() {
		return this.dealerHand;
	}


Steps to Produce/Reproduce
--------------------------
The following test:

	@Test
    public void testDealerHandSize() {
    	Dealer dealer = new Dealer();
    	List<Card> dealerHand = new ArrayList<Card>();

    	dealerHand = dealer.getHand();

    	assertEquals(0, dealerHand.size());

    	dealer.dealCard(dealer);
    	dealer.dealCard(dealer);

    	dealerHand = dealer.getHand();

    	assertEquals(2, dealerHand.size());
    }
would fail on the original code of the Dealer class because it would return 52
both times the assertEquals statement evaluated because of the faulty getHand()
function which returned the deck.  The first time it was evaluated, no cards 
had been dealt, so the deck was full.  The second time it was evaluated, the 
deck was full even though two cards had been dealt to the dealer because these
cards were returned to the deck instead of placed in the dealer's hand.

After the changes made in the description section of this report, the size of
the dealer's hand before any cards are dealt is zero.  After two cards are dealt
to the dealer, the size of the hand is two.

Expected Results
----------------
It is expected that the dealer's hand as returned by getHand() is zero before
any cards have been dealt.  After two cards have been dealt to the dealer, it
is expected that the size of the dealer's hand is two.

Actual Results
--------------
The size of the dealer's hand as returned by getHand() was 52 before any cards
were dealt.  After two cards were dealt to the dealer, the size of the hand 
returned by getHand() was still 52.
